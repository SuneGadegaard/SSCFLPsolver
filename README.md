# SSCFLPsolver
A solver for the single source capacitated facility location problem.

# Methodology
The solver uses the cut-and-solve framework in order to solve the single source capacitated facility location problem.
From version 1.2.0 we have introduced a dual ascent algorithm for solving the sparse problems.

Please see the reference manual for more information.
